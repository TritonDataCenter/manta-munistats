# Muni Statistics

This repository contains tools for downloading, manipulating, and analyzing the
arrival times of San Francisco Muni vehicles.  The collection agent download
each vehicle's position every 20 seconds.  Those positions are then mapped to
specific stops, and then those transcripts of vehicle arrivals are used to
aggregate statistics about the average trip length between different stops.
